# POKEDEX With Typescript 
 
 We'll use the incredible Pok√©API to fetch all of the data we'll need using GET requests. If you're not familiar with Pokemon, or a Pokedex, that's okay! A Pokedex is just a make-believe device that lets us look up information about Pokemon - things like their name, type, and stats.

## REPL

REPL stands for "read-eval-print loop". It's a common type of program that allows for interactivity. You type in a command, and the program evaluates it and prints the result. You can then type in another command, and so on.
